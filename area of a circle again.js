// Area of a circle
// Complete the function which will return the area of a circle with the given radius. Returned value is expected to be accurate up to tolerance of 0.01. If the radius is not positive, throw Error.

// My solution
function circleArea(radius) {
  return radius > 0 ? Math.PI * (radius ** 2) : error;
}

// These solutions aren't the top ones, idk what codewars is doing but they're not showing me the best solutions at the top and I cannot find them
